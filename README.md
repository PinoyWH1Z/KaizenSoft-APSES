* -Low Memory consumption:

------**unlike the other websites** that offers anonymous email sending services
with this one, you don't need to use any web browsers just to send, and with this tool you can avoid
consuming a lot of memory in sending emails. so why consume a lot of memory by just sending an email/message?
HELL, NO!

**Last but not the least: Anonymous.**
No one will know who really the sender is (because what the receiver will obviously see is the secured email account used by the Developer in this software.

**waiiiiiiitttt!!! Also, PRIVACY:**
* We decided to use the email service of Yandex. Why?
* -When you use our software (APSES' external smtp module), unlike Google Mail, the Yandex Mail account that we use will NEVER LOG/RECORD [Sent Messages], so you are safe even if you sent a porn link to someone. lmao :D
* (Google it or do a lot of research if you are curious)
* -Google Mail sucks (when it comes to external SMTP usages due to a lot of restrictions)
* -Yahoo is like a turtle (it takes 3-5 mins before receiving the mail? HELL, NO.)
* -AOL? just nuh....
